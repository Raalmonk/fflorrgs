# FFLorrgs Agent Guidelines

## 1. Project Context & Mission
**Goal:** We are porting "Lorrgs" (a WoW cooldown planner) to "FFLorrgs" (for Final Fantasy XIV).

**Core Logic:** The codebase is heavily based on lorgs (Python/FastAPI). We are adapting the data layer to support FF14 Jobs and Encounters instead of WoW Classes and Raids.

**Data Source:** We use FF Logs API v2 (Graph QL), which is structurally identical to Warcraft Logs but uses different endpoints.

## 2. Critical "Do Not Touch" Rules
* **Legacy Code:** Do NOT delete existing WoW data files (e.g., `lorgs/data/classes/deathknight.py`) unless explicitly instructed. We use them as templates/references for the new FF14 files.
* **Comments:** Do NOT delete existing comments. This includes docstrings, inline comments, and commented-out code blocks. They often contain critical context, original Spell IDs, or logic explanations that serve as references for the porting process.
* **Architecture:** Do NOT change the core model architecture (`lorgs/models/*`) without permission. We want to reuse the existing `UserReport`, `Fight`, and `Player` logic.
* **Files:**
    * `lorgs/clients/wcl/client.py`: Ensure `URL_API` always points to `fflogs.com`, NOT `warcraftlogs.com`.

## 3. FF14 Terminology Mapping
When converting logic, map WoW terms to FF14 terms as follows:
* **Class** -> **Job** (e.g., Scholar, Paladin).
* **Spec** -> **Job** (In FF14, Class and Spec are effectively 1:1 for end-game. Treat them as the same entity).
* **Role** -> **Role** (Tank, Healer, Melee, Ranged, Caster).
* **Covenant/Soulbind** -> Ignore (FF14 has no borrowed power systems like this).
* **Hero Talents** -> Ignore (Not applicable).

## 4. Coding Standards (Python)
* **Python Version:** 3.9+
* **Formatting:** Follow black and isort configuration defined in `pyproject.toml`.
* **Line length:** 120.
* **Type Hinting:** Use strict type hints for all new functions.
* **Imports:**
    * `from lorgs.data.classes import *` structure is used heavily in this project.
    * New Job files must be registered in `lorgs/data/classes/__init__.py`.
    * New Raid/Boss files must be registered in `lorgs/data/raids/__init__.py`.

## 5. New Data File Templates
When asking to create new data, strictly follow these patterns:

**Boss Definition (`lorgs/data/raids/example_boss.py`):**
```python
from lorgs.models.raid_boss import RaidBoss
BOSS_NAME = RaidBoss(id=123, name="Boss Name", ...)
boss = BOSS_NAME
boss.add_cast(spell_id=12345, name="Mechanic Name", ...)

Job Definition (lorgs/data/classes/job_name.py):

Python

from lorgs.models.wow_class import WowClass
from lorgs.models.wow_spec import WowSpec
# Note: For FF14, Job is both the Class and the Spec.
JOB = WowClass(id=1, name="JobName", color="#HEX")
JOB_SPEC = WowSpec(role=ROLE, wow_class=JOB, name="JobName")
JOB_SPEC.add_spell(...)
